Note for building parcel (for distribution)
    Parcel will by default reroute paths to use the absolute server toot by default
    e.g. ./style.css -> /style.css
      This means if you want to serve the files before uploading, you need to test within the root folder itself.
      Also means that serving the directory above (like where this file is)

    "build:dist": "parcel build index.html --public-url ./dist/",
      You can change the 'relative' path a build argument.
